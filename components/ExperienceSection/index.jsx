      To start with, I think I should give some background info about myself. I
      finished my master in Systems Engineering back in Argentina, during my
      time at college I was focused on software performance and programming
      languages, I was even applying to start a PhD and continue in the academic
      world.

      After doing some mandatory internships to get my degree I found myself
      really self-involved with Frontend Development and mostly curious about
      <i>{" why "}</i>
      were we building stuff. This leads me to pursue a career as a Frontend
      Engineer, but after a couple of years I realized I wanted to be even more
      involved in
      <i>{" what to build, and why to build it, "}</i>
      so I ended up transitioning to full-time Product Manager.

      Nowadays, I&apos;m getting closer to coding again after almost a year
      dedicating most of my time to Product Management and relegating coding to
      a place were I was just keeping myself up to date with main trends and
      frameworks releases.

      Currently my main coding goal is to build enjoyable User Experiences and
      supporting it with Framer Motion. I truly believe in the
      <i> Product Engineer </i>
      as a role that will emerge soon, Engineers who get really involved in
      really understanding the problem space and empathizing with the users.

# Personal website
This is my personal website. I use it mainly as a playground to try new technologies. The latest thing I was playing with was an animation library.

Anyways, I like to keep this repo clean and to follow as many good practices as possible (maybe I might push to Main without a PR sometimes tho).

I work as a Product Manager but I have my past in software development. This is a way to keep myself updated with the new trends.

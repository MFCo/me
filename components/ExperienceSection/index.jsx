      To start with, I think I should give you some background info about
      myself. In 2018, I finished my MSc in Systems Engineering in Argentina.
      During my time at college I was focused on software performance and
      programming languages and how to improve developers experience, 
      I was ready to start a PhD and continue in the academic world.

      After doing some mandatory internships to get my degree I found myself
      really self-involved with Frontend Development and mostly curious about
      <i>{" why "}</i>
      do we build stuff. This leads me to pursue a career as a Frontend
      Engineer, but after a couple of years I realized I wanted to be even more
      involved in
      <i>{" what to build, and why to build it, "}</i>
      so I ended up transitioning into full-time Product Manager.

      Currently, my main goal is to build enjoyable and valuable Products.
      Now, I'm lucky enough to be able to work again in my first passion, 
      improving the developers experience. And also, helping to make the web 
      faster, more accessible, and more inclusive.
